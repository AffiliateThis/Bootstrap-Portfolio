              I am Chris Kautz-Scanavy and I am training to become a junior full
              stack developer. I have done quite a few things since graduating
              college amost 19 years ago. After college I moved to Richmond as
              that is where my band was located and Richmond had a good music
              scene in the early 2000's. Playing doesn't pay the bills, so I
              became a beerman. Now that was fun, driving a big ass beer truck
              with 60 kegs plus, selling and delivering them. I mean I was the
              beerman... then my back said screw you, your beerman days are
              over. time to do something else.<br />

              <p>
                I was a sub teacher briefly and this was while recovering from a
                back injury and a rebuilt knee. So natuarlly it was time to do
                outside MRO sales, nuts bolts, mechanical related stuff, and
                industrial chemicals. The outside sales wasn't thing that seemed
                like a great a fit in the MRO industry. Most of these products
                could be purchased locally from the a hardware, or some
                variation of the products. This is when I decided to join
                corporate American and work in downtown Richmond doing inside
                sales for a car dealer lead generation company. I eventually
                made a transition while at the same company to the Marketing
                dept at the same company. I have been in the online marketing
                industry for 14 years. That is a long time, and it is now time
                for me to build upon the knowledge and experience to really grow
                my professional skillsets and become a full stack developer.
                Bam! Like I dropped a mic, well not really.
